# WDD

wdd is a small utility that displays a list of projects and allows you to select one and open a terminal. The projects are configured throough [wd](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd).

At this point and most likely in the future, this utility will be useful for me and me alone. Also, the code is useful for me to explore Rust and in no way is idiomatic.
